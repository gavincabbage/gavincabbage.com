I live in Boston with my partner Molly.
I grew up in Canton, Massachusetts and spent a few years in Richmond, Virginia
after attending the College of William & Mary before returning to the area.

I work as a software engineer for InfluxData, writing
Go to help build the second generation open-source and cloud iteration of InfluxDB.
When I'm not coding, I'm usually cooking something or gaming.

I like to go outside sometimes too. 
Here's a picture of me making a funny face with Molly at Acadia National Park in Maine.
