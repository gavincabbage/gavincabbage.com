I live in Boston with my partner Molly, where I spend
my time writing software and cooking and eating good food.
Lately I've been helping build InfluxData's second-generation
cloud platform and braising a lot of pork butt for tacos. 

I like to go outside sometimes too.
Here's a picture of me making a funny face with Molly in Acadia National Park.
