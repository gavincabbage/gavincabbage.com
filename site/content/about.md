My name is Gavin. This is my website- there are many like it, but this one is mine.

I work as a Software Engineer. Lately I have preferred using the Go programming language and containerization technologies
like Docker to build distributed backend systems. 
I also maintain [il2missionplanner.com](https://il2missionplanner.com), a navigation app for the *Il-2 Sturmovik* series of flight simulators. 
In my spare time I enjoy cooking, reading about history, 
RTS video games and flight sims, and of course coding other random things from time to time. 

I grew up in Canton, Massachusetts, just south of Boston.
After graduating from Canton High School in 2010, I attended The College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. 
In 2014 I graduated with a *B.S.* in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.

After college, I worked at Capital One for four years before moving on to the CodeShip team at CloudBees.
