**A classic Old Fashioned recipe:**

- 2oz. bourbon or rye, sipping quality
- 1-2 sugar cubes or syrup equivalent, to taste
- Angostura bitters
- Orange rind
- Ice

Begin by adding a few dashes of bitters and a similar amount of water to the sugar cubes in a mixing vessel.
Adjust the amount of sugar and bitters to taste. Crush the sugar cubes and stir to dissolve.

Add half the whiskey and a single small ice cube. Stir until melted. This will take a few minutes.

Add the remaining whiskey and an orange rind. Stir.

Strain into a stout glass over a large ice cube. Garnish with a second orange rind.

Spritz the orange rind over the glass and rim. Enjoy!

**Notes:**

I prefer a single sugar cube and up to five dashes of bitters. Most recipes will recommend less bitters. Find your preference.

My preferred whiskey for this drink is Bulleit Rye. 
Bourbon is traditional but Rye tends to be less sweet, balancing the sweetness from the sugar and other ingredients.

You may also chill the glass before serving.
