I spent a summer in Ukraine in 2007. With sour cream and fresh dill, this soup brings me right back to Kyiv.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup of celery, diced
- 1 cup onions, diced
- 1 cup of cabbage, roughly chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon of butter
- 8 cups water or broth
- 1 can diced tomatoes
- 3 medium beets, peeled, half grated and half diced
- 1 or 2 medium carrots, grated
- 1 medium potato, diced
- salt and pepper
- fresh dill, chopped
- sour cream
- dark bread, such as rye, pumpernickel or borodinsky

## Instructions

1. Sauté the celery, onions and cabbage in the butter until soft, approximately 10 minutes.
2. Add the garlic and sauté for another minute or two until fragrant.
3. Add diced tomatoes and broth or water. Bring to a boild before reducing to medium heat.
4. Add beets, carrots and potato. Simmer until softened.
5. Remove from heat. Season with salt and pepper and stir in dill.
6. Serve, garnished with a dollop of sour cream and more dill, with bread.

## Notes

- This recipe is for vegetarian borscht, but meat can also be added for a heartier rendition.
- While sour cream is traditional, yogurt can be subsituted for a healthier dish. I prefer Icelandic skyr.
